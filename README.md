IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

---

Project Overview  
The IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION project aims to classify iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms.  
This project utilizes the classic Iris dataset and demonstrates steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.  
The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook format.
