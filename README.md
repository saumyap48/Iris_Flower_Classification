## Project Overview

The IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION project aims to classify iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms. This project utilizes the classic Iris dataset and demonstrates steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result visualization. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of classification results

## Getting Started

To begin working with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumit-Agnihotri/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.git
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
